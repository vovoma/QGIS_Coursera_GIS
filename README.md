# QGIS_Coursera_GIS
This is my attempt to align the course exercises that are normally conducted in ERSI'sd ArcMap but to be done using QGIS.

The end result will be a series of pdf files, one for each exercise, that show how to do the exercise using QGIS. Not 
all actions can accomplished will be able to be accomplished using QGIS and when that happens it will be state and
if figured out an alternative will be presented.

The file structure will be a master directory for each course and under that there will be directories for pictures, maps produced
and working notes.

The PDF files will be produced using LaTeX, and if I have time or the inclination I will write a short explaination of what I did 
but the source files will be available here. the .gitignore will keep intermeadiate and produced files out of the repro and only
on my local copy. However, if yoiu are interested all you have to do is run the tex file thorough your flavor of TeX and explore to
your hearts content.
